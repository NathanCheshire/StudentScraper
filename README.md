# StudentScraper 
## By Nathan Cheshire

Student Scraper is a web scraping tool that uses Python and Selenium to scrape student details from MSU's myState.

logindata.txt should exist in the same directory as `Poster.py` or `WebCrawler.py` and contain your netid and password in the following format: netid,password.

## Method 1: WebCrawling

This method will simply search through all permutations of first,last containing aa aa, aa ab,...,zz zz, until all student records have been collected and saved to text files. This was my first approach to this problem and is quite inefficient so I would not recommend using `WebCrawler.py`. This section did, however, teach me a lot about selenium, webscraping, and webcrawling. I was able to figure out how to pass both authentication pages using selenium via this approach.

## Method 2: POST requests

Directly accessing the backend and sending post requests to acquire data is a much faster and more efficient solution. By making a request in Chrome, one can press f12 and go to the networks tab to see any requests recently made. You can then take the request URL and POST data (formData) in this case, and write a script to send POST requests and parse the returned data. First, method 2 starts a selenium instance and authenticates itself. The cookies generated via this authentication are then copied over to the python requests object (it isn't necessary to send them with every POST). Method 2 also inserts all parsed student data into a postgres backend for easy storage/access. Data visualizations with the collected student data are soon to come.

# Student Queries

Assuming you have created a Posgres database on your local machine with the same schema I outlined in inside of `Poster.py` you should have success executing any of the queries inside of `StudentQueries.sql`. This is mostly a scratch pad, however.

# Data/

Data holds the csvs I generate `from MapGenerator.py` which are subsequently utilized for a USA state-by-state html output depicting the percentage of students from each of the 50 states. This is possible via the Folium framework in Python.

# MapQuestionAPI

This script is what I used to query the MapQuest api and convert all of the student addresses within my postgres local db to lat,lon pairs. Resultingly, this opens a plethora of possible data visualizations. Both the home address and office address for each valid user was converted to lat, lon pairs which are stored in their respective tables: home_addresses, office_addresses. This schemas include the netid as the PK, as well as a double for both the lat and lon.

# MapGenerator

This is the main data visualization script file. It contains methods such as getting an aerial view of a student's home based soley on their netid, producing a heat map of all students at MSU, and even state by state visualizations for statitistics such as enrollment by state.

# Example

By calling `generateStaticImageFromNetid()` and passing in a netid such as `wvb26`, I can easily produce the following figure within seconds. I find this an exceptionally cool party trick (if you're into parties and all that).
