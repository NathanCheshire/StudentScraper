# StudentScraper 
## By Nathan Cheshire

Student Scraper is a web scraping tool that uses Python and Selenium to scrape student details from MSU's myState.

logindata.txt should exist in the same directory as `StudentScraper.py` and contain your netid and password in the following format: netid,password.

The script will even automatically request a duo push so make sure to accept that while the script is running so that it can iterate through all student records and output the student data.
